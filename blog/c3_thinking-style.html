    <h3>Which Am I?</h3>
    <p>Before starting Phase 0 at DBC, they had all of the students take a test to see what our thinking and learning styles were. There are 4 possiblities : concrete sequential, abstract sequential, concrete random and abstract random. My learning style was evenly split between concrete and abstract sequential both with 44 points and following closely behind was abstract random with 32 points. I did not score even 1 point for concrete random which is not surprising.Concrete random thinkers like to experiment, take risks, and work through problems independently. Not to say that I am not capable of any of those things but that is not where I am the most comfortable learning. As a concrete sequential, I prefer order, learning in a logical sequence, predictablity and being able to follow clear directions. As an abstract sequential, I like to analyze situations before making a decison but find comfort knowing I have people who can help along the way. As an abstact random, I am a good listener, value harmony and positive relationships and do not like to be micromanaged or forced into competitive situations.

    <h3>Learning in DBC</h3>
   <p>My experience with Phase 0 has been filled with mostly anxiety, sprinkled in with some fatigue and excitement. My anxiety is usually triggered when I don't understand the ciriculum's directions or when I am feeling pressed for time. Not that I am saying that I am not intelligent but I process information slower than some people. To combat this I usually reread and write notes in a more sequential order so I can better absorb the material. This has worked for me in the past but it is more time consuming and is conflicting with my ability to work during Phase 0. After analyzing all the different learning types, I recognize the discomfort I feel following vague directions is a challenge experienced by concrete sequentials. My discomfort in time pressure is a challenge experience by abstract sequentials. However, I believe most of my difficulty all roots from lack of self confidence. Instead of just saying to myself "Yes, the directions are unclear but I will find a way to figure it out" or "Yes, I don't have much time but I will do what I have to get it done." I just start feeling like I am in over my head. I believe this is primarly I have lived most of my life with a fixed mindset. I understand and agree with the principle of a growth mind set but habits are not broken overnight.</p>
   <h3>What Works For Me</h3>
   <p>I recognize that in order to succeed based on my learning style, I need to have a sense of order, clear instructions and expectations of what is required of me. Organization is key for me whether I am taking notes or planning out how to execute multiple tasks at hand. If I do not write down and organize my thoughts, I have too much floating in my head to concentrate on any one thing. I enjoy problem solving but part of my learning process is being able to turn to someone who can help me. I also recognize in collaborative settings I work better with others who are fair, respectful and cooperative.</p>
   <h3>What I Have to Work On</h3>
   <p>However, the reality of DBC and in life does not always provide ideal situations. DBC is an intense and fast pace program that hosts many different kinds of learners so it is important that I try to be flexible and expand on how I learn and engage. I tend to spend too much time learning something before I move on because I want to make sure I fully understand it before I move on. This can be counter productive especially in a time crunch. Instead I will set a realistic time box to accomplish a task and note any areas where I felt weak and come back to it another time. Confidence building is going to be the biggest challenge for myself since it will require that I do things out of my comfort zone. I will set aside more time to purely experiment with what I have learned versus just being guided. I will try to practice more of the growth mindset and take more risks regardless of the preceived consequences of failure. This will inevitably lead to failures but hopefully at some point I will see that not all failures are devastating and and do eventually lead to success.
