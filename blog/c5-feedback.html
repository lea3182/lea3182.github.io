    <h3>The Value of Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      From the very beginning DBC makes it very clear to their students that feeback is important. Learning how to give and receive actionable, kind and specific feedback is pivotal especially since students will be pair programming on a regular basis. Each student posseses different personalities, communication skills and coding background. Not every pair session will go smoothly but there is a lesson for both parties to learn if feedback can be communicated to each other clearly and constructively.
    </p>
    <h3>Pairing</h3>
    <p>My experience so far with pair programming has been fun, frustrating, and intimidating but most importantly extremely helpful. Feelings of intimidation arise when I am paired with someone who is sharper or more knowledgeable. Since it takes me a little longer to get my thoughts together so I end up feel immense pressure to keep up or to contribute. Feelings of frustration arise when I am paired with someone who dominates the session or if a challenge takes far longer than it should because of lack or miscommunication. For both situations, I have always tried to address the issue promptly with my pair with whatever insecurities or frustrations I had felt. You can't expect them to read your mind and there can be no chance of a better solution if your pair is in the dark.
</p>
<p> The majority of the time I thoroughly enjoy pairing and have a lot of fun doing so. I try to build a rapport with my pair so we can both feel comfortable enough to be honest with our opinions and emotions. Not only are we able to bounce ideas off each other without fear of judgement, we also enjoy a few laughs in between. Completing a difficult challenge with a pair can build solidarity. I find myself developing friendships with people that were complete strangers only weeks ago. We all understand what each other are going through and become invested in each others success. For me that is what peer pairing is all
</p>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>It's not always easy hearing negative feedback but I pride myself in taking constructive criticsm well. However, giving constructive criticsm is an area I apparently need to improve on. Even with anonoymous feedback, it is difficult for me to convey constructive feedback since I feel that I have been consistently the weaker pair. Even after the most frustrating pairing sessions I find it to difficult to leave any criticism if the pair was a really nice person. However, I have to remind myself that I am doing them a robbing them of learning experience by not being honest.
</p>
<p>Every time I read a feedback left for me I get nervous. I am fearful that someone will think I was a "bad" pair. I am always afraid I will never contribute enough or I will slow the process down. Fortunately all of my feedback so far has been very positive! My pairs seem to enjoy pairing with me even if it takes a long time. They seem to appreciate that I am vocal, open, considerate and friendly. A couple of my past pairs made some suggestions that I find to be very helpful and I am grateful that it was brought to my attention. All the positive feedback has been a great confidence booster but I need to remember any negative feedback is just an opportunity to improve.</p>
