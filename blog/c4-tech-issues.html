    <h3>The Cost of Innovation</h3>
    <p>When asked to write a blog about a specific problem faced in the tech industy, I immediately thought Economics! Economics??? Yes! As a former resident of San Francisco and a former econ major, it is difficult not to observe how technology's innovations impact of local and global economy.

In a podcast episode titled "How Safe is Your Job?" aired on Freakonomic Radio, the disscusion pertained to the economical effects of technological innovation. Economists refer to it as "creative destruction". As techonology advances certain industries become obsolete and are then replaced by other industries that offer more jobs or possibly fewer jobs due to automation. In all fairness, creative destruction has been always been apart of human history but some economists fear the impact is far greater today. Economist fear the rate of destruction is growing exponentially as technology advancesment occur rapidly. Now the magnitude of job displacement is greater and transition for the workers take far longer. One economist claims that 2.5 million people are now working less that full time today than in 2007. One example, he refers to is the success of the Kindle and how it has signficantly contributed to the closures of hundreds of Borders and Barnes and Noble Stores.

<p>From a personal perspective I have seen the boom of the tech industry in San Francisco and have benefited myself. During my time at City College, I supported myself as a full time Lyft driver. While I, and thousands more like myself, benefited from the creation of this ride share app, SF taxi drivers struggled as their wages and industry became threatened. As time went by and popularity grew, more and more taxi drivers switch over Lyft or Uber to preserve their wages. It was easy (or perhaps heartless) for me to believe: "Change or become obsolete." However, with Uber's partnership with Google's self driving cars is any Uber, Lyft or taxi driver's job safe? In spite of all the new gadgets or apps being released that supposed to improve our lives, do we ever wonder enough "What is the real cost of all this innovation?"
