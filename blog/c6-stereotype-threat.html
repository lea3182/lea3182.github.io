      This week DBC wanted us to discuss stereotype.
</p>
<p>
In an online article, "The Stereotype Threat to Workplace Diversity: Dr. Claude Steele Mesmerizes Audience", stereotype threats is "the threat of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype or the fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm that stereotype. Call it subconscious self-handicapping." According to the article, Dr. Claude Steele believes stereotype threats are "one of the major barriers holding back the achievement of Blacks, women and other underrepresented groups."<br><br>

 This seems a bit simplistic. Isn't there more involved? Wouldn't racism or socioeconomics play more of a barrier? As an Asian woman I am no stranger to stereotypes but I do not feel like I have been personally a victim of it. Indeed I have self-handicapping thoughts but they stem from my own insecurities and self doubt, but not from stereotypes. It is very difficult with me empathize how a person can be so severly hindered by stereotypes when I have seen people around me persevere through far more difficult and apparent obstacles. I believe that I am a open person but on this matter I find it difficult to detach my own experiences and find more validity in this issue. My intention is not to offend or to dismiss anyone who can identify being affected by stereotype threats, so I aplologize for my ignorance or if my opinions are offensive. I am clearly uncomfortable writing about this and hope I have a more agreeable topic to report on next week.
