    <h3>Affirmations and Values</h3>
    <p>Whether I can identify with stereotype threats or not, I do believe in the power of affirmations. I am someone who is not very self confident and suffer from imposter syndrome. While I am very lucky to have such a supportive network of friends and family, much of my affirmations must come from within.</p>
    <p>Whenever I feel that I am in over my head or not good enough I reflect back to a couple of years ago when I completed my first marathon. Once I had crossed the finish line I felt a great deal of pride, and a great sense of accomplishment. However, in order to attain that personal victory, it took a great deal of commitment and persistance, both to a degree that I never knew I was capable of. During the last several weeks, as I have been going through Phase 0 at DBC, I have had to think back to my first marathon on many occasions. I needed to remind myself that I can do amazing things if I am committed and persistant. In general it is important that I try to live up to these values everyday so they can serve as a constant and positive reinforcement in my life, even when I am not struggling.</p>
    <p>If I had to choose one value above all else, I would say persistance is the one that is the most important to me. In my experience the most successful people that I have met all showed persistance. They did not let life's detours or failures stop them. They may stop for a moment, reasses their plan but they keep going forward. This is not as easy as it sounds as many of us in the worst circumstances would be tempted to quit. It's understandable to come apart but the most important to pick yourself back up and keep going. Even at my lowest point, I always try to remind myself to keep pushing forward and is something I remind others to do. When my friend who is working and going to school showed signs of fatigue and frustration, I reminded her of something I try to tell myself: Your hardships are only temporary. When you achieve your goal, no one can take that away from you. Keep pushing forward.</p>
    <p>I can see the power of affirmations when battling stereotype threats. I personally don't identify with stereotype threats as I try not to concern myself with what others think of me. The person I need to be concerned with is myself. I can be my own worst enemy. Next week once I start Phase 1, my values will be put to the test. With the demands of an intense cirriculum I will need to constantly remind myself of what I am capable of overcoming. In addition, learning to celebrating small victories and accept support from other cohorts will only help my determination and persistance.</p>
