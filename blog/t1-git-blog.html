      What are the benefits of version control?

      Version control is a system that records changes made to a file made by the user. It allows the user to recall or revert back to specific versions of that file. If the user's file has been corrupted, the user can easily recover any previous versions of that file prior to corruption.

        How does git help you keep track of changes?

        Git is a very popular version control software that keeps track of your changes. When saving changes, Git tracks when, what and why changes were made. A log of tracked changes can be viewed with command: git log. In this log the user will be able to see the details of the changes (who did it, what was changed, why and when it was changed). The log also allows user to view the file before and after a specific change.

        Why use GitHub to store your code?

        Github is an open source repository hosting service, so in other words, it is a free online social filing system. It allows a user to go on to Github and copy a folder or file from a different user. Once it is copied (forked) the user can save it on to their own computer where they can modify it without rewriting the original file. If the user wants to share their modifications they can send a 'pull request' and if the owner approves they can 'merge' the changes to the original file. This is a very important concept when you have multiple people remotely working on the same file or project.
