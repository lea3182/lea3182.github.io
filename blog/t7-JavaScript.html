    <h3>Hashes vs Objects</h3>
    <p>For the last few weeks I have been trying to get a handle on Ruby but recently we have shifted to Javascript. I felt when it came to similarities Javascript shared more syntax and concepts that were more in line with C++ than Ruby. When it was time to learn about Javascript objects I realized they were very similar to Ruby hashes but there were some differences that I had process.</p>
    <h3>Similarities:</h3>
    <p>Ruby Hashes and Javascript Objects are both a collection of key/value pairs. Keys must be unique but values do not. Both are encapsulated in curly braces and separated by commas. Values in both Hashes and Objects can be accessed by referencing the key in bracket notation.</p>
    <p>Ruby Hash:<br>

    <p>Javascript Object:<br>
    <img src="Object.png"><img src="Obj out.png"></p>
    <h3>Differences:</h3>
    <p>Javascript's object keys are referred to as properties. Properties tell us about the object. An object's property value can be a string, integer, boolean as well but can also be a function. When a function is part of a object it is known as a method. Methods represent tasks that are associated with the object. In Ruby methods are not a feature of hashes. You would call a method using period followed by the method name.<br><br>
    <img src="Ruby method.png"> <br><br>In Javascript you can access a property or method the same way as you would a Ruby method as long as the property or method has a valid variable name. If not, you would use bracket notation.<br><br><img src="Object prop.png" width=300 height=200> </p>
