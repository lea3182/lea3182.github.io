    <h3>Conflict</h3>
    <p>My last conflict was a great learning experience and involved a good friend of mine. We are both very busy with our own lives and do not get to see each other often but we both make an effort to catch up. We had carefully planned in advance to have a one one one brunch date. However, the day off she was over 30 minutes late. When she arrived, she unexpectedly brought along another friend. She did not acknowlege that she was late or that fact that she brought another friend unannounced. I should have been happy but I was really bothered.</p>
    <p>This may not have upset other people but I was offended for few reasons. Firstly, it's understandable if someone is a few minutes behind but being over 30 minutes late is pretty rude especially if there is no real good reason. Second, my friend did not offer any apology for making me wait so long. Lastly, she freely invited another friend to our one on one date without letting me know.</p>
    <p>I did not display my discontent and I tried to be a good sport and act like everything was okay. We ultimately had great time at brunch. However, I still felt bothered by her actions even after brunch. I knew my friend's offense were not severe but I could not understand why it upset me so much. After talking with another good friend I realized my frustrations were from feeling that my friend did not value my time. At that point in my life, I was working full time and going to school part time so there was little time for much else. The little free time I had to spare, I would make an effort spend it with people that I actually cared about rather than taking that time for myself. So when my friend showed up late, I felt my efforts to make time for her were not appreciated. When she did not offer an apology for showing up late, I felt she did not care about my time and how little free time I have. The fact she brought another friend made me feel like she didn't value our one on one time. I felt like I was not good enough.</p>
    <p>A few days later I had a conversation with my friend letting her know how I felt, not my frustrations themselves but my basic emotions. She was surprised that I had felt that way and sincerely apologized for coming across that way. It turns out she brought her friend because she really wanted to see me too and they were late because they tried to buy me so flowers. What a terrible misunderstanding! </p>
    <p>When ever I find myself getting upset or find myself in conflict, I try to think about what I have learned from this experience. I cannot expect other people to know what I am feeling and I must communicate them. More importantly, before I present my feelings to someone else, I have to fully understand them myself. I think if I had just chastised my friend without understanding what I was really upset about, I think it would have sent a completely different and inaccurate message. I have learned it is important to honestly acknowledge the basic emotions during a time of conflict but to not make any assumptions about the other party's intent until their side is also heard.</p>
