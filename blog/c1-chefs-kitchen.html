        I know I was only suppose to watch parts of Shereef's video but I couldn't help myself. I have been really nervous about attending DBC and this video is exactly what I neede to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on the video, what's your take on the DBC experience?
      Based on Shereef's video I get the impression that DBC is going to be a very intense and challenging experience, one that will probably push me to the brink a few times, but that I will also be supported with compassion and empathy from both staff and peers.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is your impression of DBC?
      The video only confirms that I made the right decision in picking DBC versus other bootcamps.
      The fact they value emotional intelligence over IQ sets them apart from the other schools that I have looked into. It is easier to pump out coding monkeys by just focusing the coding aspect but DBC's mindfulness of the human element shows they are trying to lay the right foundation so their students can have careers as successful developers.

        How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
        Though I can be shy and introverted at times, I feel that I will thrive in this culture. I fully expect to feel overwhelmed, frustrated and constantly out of my comfort zone throughtout the program but DBC's value on vulnerability, compassion and empathy are encouraging. Though peer programing may have it's challenges but I feel that I will be able to benefit from a pair that is more advanced than me or one who is struggling versus doing it all on my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have your expectations of DBC changed?
      No. The school sets the right expectations, which for me I see it as: DBC will equip the student with the tools and support they need to succeed but it is ultimately up to the student to decide their level of success.

      Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
      My answer to both questions: HELL YES!
      I can't wait to see how far I can push myself and what I can learn. I am really looking forward to meeting my cohort. People are a great source of inspiration and support. At the same time I am so nervous, at times terrified. Sometimes my mind is my own worst enemy. I am one of those people who suffer from imposter syndrome and need to develop a way to cope with being uncomfortable learning so much in such little time.
