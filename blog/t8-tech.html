    <h3>What is SQL Injection?</h3>
    <p>SQL injection is a technique used to attack a databased driven website and have been around for over a decade. Attackers construct and  malicious SQL statements that are executed along side with normal SQL statements via client-side input. Attackers then gain acess to potentially all records in the database, allowing them to view, modify, delete or add records or transactions.This could lead to theft of sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, login information and lead to identity spoofing. The attack could even lead to a full compromise of database server.

    <p>
     The ones most at risk of a potential SQL injection attack are applications that accept user input and store data in a back-end database such as banking and retail sites. SQL injection detection and prevention are both indepth topics but there are a few general guidelines. For injection detection code reviewing, auditing present state of security systems as well as regularly performing a web security audit after each change or addition to website are good measures. For prevention, use paramaterized statements which limits the amount of influence the attacker can have against queries. Enforce strict input validation rules where data is checked for correct type, length, format or only accepts character from a whitelist of safe values for added measure.
