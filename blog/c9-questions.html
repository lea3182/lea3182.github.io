    <h3>The Art of Asking Questions</h3>
    <p>How well do you ask questions? That may sound like a silly question since we all know how to ask questions but do we ever really consider how effective they are? It is important to understand if you do not ask the right question it will be difficult to get the right answer. Think about the last time someone asked you an unclear or confusing question. How long did it take before both parties were on the same page. Did it lead to any frustration? Were you as willing to help answer the question?</p>
    <p>I am no an expert in the art of asking questions but I have developed a system that has worked for me. First, I start formulating my question by simply writing down. During this stage I do not concern myself with grammar or even clarity. The point is just to get every single thought related to what I want to know on paper, think stream of consciousness. Once it is all written down, it's time to better frame the question. I review it as many times necessary to really understand what I am asking.How many questions am I asking? Once I have clear idea of what I am asking, I try to rewrite the question as concisely as possible. If a question is too verbose or convoluted it loses its effectiveness, so get to the point. My question will make perfect sense to me because I obviously wrote it. However, would it come across the same way to someone else? I read the question out loud and pretend I am hearing this question for the first time. I then ask myself the following questions: Is the question clear on what it is asking? Is there any confusion or ambiguity? Are background information or examples necessary to better understand the question? If I feel adjustments are necessary, I will repeat the process until I am satisfied. It may seem like a long process but I found the added effort to be worth it, especially if there is only one opportunity to ask. Sometimes articulation requires practice. Any questions? :)
