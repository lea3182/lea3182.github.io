      In CSS you can display an element many differnt ways but the one I struggled with was inline vs inline block. From what I have researched this is my conclusion though I still struggle to apply it.



      Since inline elements do not have line break before or after it, it allows other elements to be place to their left or right.Inline elements observe any left or right margins or padding that have been set but does not observe top or bottom settings. They also cannot have a width or height set. Inline block behave like a block but can be placed like an inline element where it allows for other elements to be place to their left or right. Unlike inline elements, inline block do respect top and bottom margins as well as height and width.
