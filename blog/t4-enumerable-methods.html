    <h2>When to Use #map Method Over #each Method</h2>
    <p>The #map method operates very much like #each method. They both cycle through an array one element at a time through a given block of code. The difference is that #map will return a new array containing the result of each element after it has gone through the block, while #each will return the original array even after going through the block. #map does not alter the size of the array or the order of elements but rather just stores the accumulated results of each elements iteration.
    </p>
    <p>Using #each will process each element in the array through the block but will return the original elements not the results.</p>
    <div class="example">
     array = [ 1, 2, 3 ]<br>
     array.each {|x| puts x * 2 }   ====>  This will output 2 4 6 on the screen<br>
     puts array                     ====>  but this will return 1 2 3 since #each does not
                                          store the result of each element's iteration<br>
    </div>
    <p>Using #maps will allow the results to be stored in a new array.</p>
     <div class="example">
      array = [ 1, 2, 3 ]<br>
      new_mapped_array = array.map {|x| x * 2 }<br>
      puts new_mapped_array        ====> This will output 2 4 6<br>
