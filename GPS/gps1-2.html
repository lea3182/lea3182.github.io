            <p> A technique used for learning or implementing that involves two people collaborating as either a driver or a navigator. The developers can switch roles consistently and learn from one another regardless of level.

        <p> Pair programming teaches you how to work with someone else.  The learning process is also accelerated because you have twice the amount of brain power focusing on the same problem.
            Programming is a collaborative enviornment!

                <li> Navigator will point out syntax or logic errors whereas the driver is creating the code.</li>
                <li> Both roles contribute to making the code and both should speak up when there is a bug or a design flaw.  </li>

<!-- Reflection

  I was actually dreading this GPS session since I had so much difficulty with the CSS portion, especially when it came to positioning. However, it turns our that I did not have an assigned pair so it would just be my guide Morgan and myself. I was actually excited about the unintentional one on one session. Morgan was especially nice and patient as I struggled with understanding what I was trying to build. Morgan drove while builing the wireframe as I shared my ideas for what the site should include. Once we had moved on to the HTML and CSS portion I was mostly driving as I continued to check in with her. She would answer some of my question with a question just get my brain going. When making changes in the CSS file but not seeing it reflected, she had me take a step back and consider what was missing and I soon realized my error. Unfortunately our time was up by the time we were starting to positon the divs but she offered some insight that was extremely helpful.
